Hi, I’m @shyogaswara. I'm Indonesian curently learning python and the like, 
just in case i got fired from my current job as a civil servants.
I usually use python to create a map like earthquake distribution, or
to visualize a dataset, and creating database, which i've done in my
own office. Of course my expertises are in using GIS for landslide,
earthquake, and recently tsunami hazardous mapping.

For now, im broading my knowledge into game making, inspired by ConcernedApe,
and machine learning, for study purposses.
