Hi, I’m @shyogaswara. I'm Indonesian curently learning python and the like, 
just in case i got fired from my current job as a civil servants.
I usually use python to create a map like earthquake distribution, or
to visualize a dataset, and creating database, which i've done in my
own office. The biggest project i've ever made with python is an intranet
website to access database using flask.
I kinda have interest on creating a game with python and also learning django
for now.

You can reach me by sending email to sh.yogaswara@gmail.com
